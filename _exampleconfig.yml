# Permission Levels
#       A big change from the old setup is permission Levels
#        Owner is considered level 0. All restricted commands can be run
#       Level 1 - L2 restrictions as well as the configure command
#       Level 2 - L3 restrictions as well as BotMute and Restart
#       Level 3 - L4 + Override Role-specific commands. (Kick, Ban, User Mute)
#       Level 4 - Custom Commands and ability to delete images from gallery

# Permissions are not necessary and roles are perfectly fine to use, levels just supercede roles in most cases.

level:
  l1:
  - 'make a list here'
  - 'also here'
  l2:
  - 'tadaa'
