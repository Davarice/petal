This is an un-formatted change log offering slightly more insight and dev notes than the commit history.

[v0.4.3 Development]
This is the current version as writing this changelog. Nothing really of worth here besides a mental note of previous improvements.
- !mute now uses the API and Role style muting versus just role
- MOTD/Patch Asks is now on MongoDB versus a local storage.
- Removed Herobrine

[v0.4.4 Development]
After losing my mind over normalized and localized time zones in python, I decided to be lazy and just do arithmetic conversions
You would not believe how long that took versus how long it should have took. Also, the void system had a slight naming glitch.
My fault for using common names.

- Added !tz <source> | <dest> conversion
- !void bug fix
- Added this here changelog.

[v0.5.0]
This has been a thorn in my side for so long. The members system that used a huge json file to hold all the information is now gone.
The module is gone. Everything is databased now.

--6 hours later--
*out of breath, pale,  and sweaty* You ever remember that you forgot to make something and then you realize it can be system breaking and you're just glad nobody noticed?
Yeah....

I can finally start working on cleaning up sections and adding features that people ask for.
- Removed members.py, this may present bugs along the way.
- Converted everything from mySQL to mongoDB
- Lost sleep
- Subscription system now works
- Optimizations and bug fixes
- Lost sleep....

[v0.5.0.1] Bug fixes and making the subscription system work better. Not much to say here.
