This is an un-formatted change log offering slightly more insight and dev notes than the commit history.

[v0.4.3 Development]
This is the current version as writing this changelog. Nothing really of worth here besides a mental note of previous improvements.
- !mute now uses the API and Role style muting versus just role
- MOTD/Patch Asks is now on MongoDB versus a local storage.
- Removed Herobrine

[v0.4.4 Development]
After losing my mind over normalized and localized time zones in python, I decided to be lazy and just do arithmetic conversions
You would not believe how long that took versus how long it should have took. Also, the void system had a slight naming glitch.
My fault for using common names.

- Added !tz <source> | <dest> conversion
- !void bug fix
- Added this here changelog.
